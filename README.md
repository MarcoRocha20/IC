The general objective of this work is to automate the construction of interactive panels, aiming to obtain and present data for analysis and decision-making, transmitting information assertively, and increasing the impact of this information. The specific objectives are the construction of a shiny application for applying questionnaires and another shiny application for visualizing the data obtained.
Furthermore, we aim to allow applications to be customized through different layout options, thus providing different options that can be used according to the one that best adheres to the research topic.
At the same time, we provide applications that can be easily made available and published due to integration with Google Drive and the use of the Shinysurveys package. In other words, the Shinysurveys form can be integrated with Google Drive, and the analysis application can be integrated with the data saved in it; therefore, all points from creating the form to obtaining the data and creating the analysis are properly integrated.
